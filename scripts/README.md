# Scripts Directory

Good place for:

1.  Migration scripts that only need to run on one environment. 
2.  Migration scripts that are long-running and should be run prior to, or after, an update.
    -  Short running data updates should be included in migrations.
    -  Long running data updates should not because the application is in maintenance mode while migrations run.
3.  Custom scripts that can be useful for development or deployment.
