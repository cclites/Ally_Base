<b>Client Payment Agreement</b><br><br>

This Client Payment Agreement (the "Agreement") entered into on the date first written below, is by and between the undersigned recipient (as defined below), an individual residing at the address listed below (together with recipient’s Authorized Representative, if any), herein referred to as the "Client", and Ally Home Care, LLC ("Ally"), a Pennsylvania limited liability company (collectively, the "Parties" and each a "Party"):

<br><br>

Accordingly, the Parties agree as follows:<br><br>

1.	Payments to Ally by you: As consideration for the services provided by Ally hereunder, you agree to pay Ally a processing fee. This fee is already included in your cost of care and is NOT an additional charge. After you have executed this agreement and returned a signed copy to Ally, Ally will begin receiving Electronic visit data from your caregiver(s) and will charge or debit your account each week as provided herein. The amount charged to your credit card or debited to your bank account each week will equal the sum of: (i) the amount owed to your caregiver(s) for the care they provided to you; (ii) the corresponding amount payable to your Referral agency; and (iii) the corresponding Ally Fee, also known as the total hourly fee. You acknowledge and agree that all such fees, charges, and costs are subject to change and that the Ally Fee may be adjusted from time to time by Ally in writing. You also agree to promptly provide Ally with written notice of any changes to the credit card and bank account information you provide to Ally and acknowledge that any delay in payment to Ally may result in a delay of payment to your caregiver(s). You agree that you are solely responsible for any issues that may arise because of delay of payment to your caregiver(s).
<br><br>
2.	Payment Methods:  Ally accepts payment via bank transfer (ACH), VISA, MasterCard, American Express or Discover for any Client balances.  Client’s preferred payment method (the "Payment Method") and contact information must be provided by Client in Exhibit A of this Agreement. Client agrees to maintain at all times valid Payment Method(s) on file with Ally capable of satisfying any accrued Total Billings.  Client agrees to promptly provide Ally with written notice of any changes to Client’s Payment Method and/or update payment method on file directly in the software system. Client acknowledges that failing to pay for services for any reason will interrupt caregiver payments and services and is liable for total billings.
<br><br>
3.	Payment Authorization:  Client authorizes Ally to automatically charge Client’s Payment Method for the accrued balance of Total Billings each Billing Cycle, all in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.  Client further understands that the names "Ally Senior Care Pmt" or "Ally Caregiver Payments" may appear on their credit card or bank statement with respect to these charges. Client will be charged $25.00 for any invalid chargeback made to an Ally charge to the client payment method on file.

4.	Payment Responsibility:  Client is responsible for payment of any accrued Client balance each Billing Cycle.  Any outstanding Client portion of Total Billings not paid within thirty (30) calendar days of the applicable Billing Cycle will accrue simple interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid portion.  Client agrees that Client is liable for all amounts due to caregivers, Client’s referral agency and Ally for services provided.  In the event Client is unable or unwilling to fully satisfy any financial obligation under this Agreement, the entire amount owed will be deemed an obligation of his or her guarantor, if applicable, and/or any estate applicable to Client.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein, Ally may refer collection of any amounts due hereunder to any collection agency and/or attorney, and Client will be liable for the payment of any and all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, associated with any such collection effort.

6.	Effect of Non-Payment:  Client understands and acknowledges that non-payment of any Client balance for any reason may interrupt caregiver Services and that Client is responsible for any issues or liabilities that arise from not satisfying caregiver payments.  Client further acknowledges that if Client’s Payment Method shall become invalid at any time due to insufficient funds, closed account or any other reason, that Ally will discontinue Ally services until a valid Payment Method is supplied.  Ally will additionally notify Client’s caregivers and referral agency if Client Payment Method becomes inactive or invalid for any reason.

Any waiver by either Party of any breach of any term or condition hereof shall be effective only if in writing and such writing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach, term or condition of this Agreement.
